The objective of the paper we are modeling as indicated in our Team Checkpoint B is: explain the impact of AirBnB rentals on local tourist communities.
The paper indicates that AirBnB cannot expand further without destroying local communities.
The paper utilizes data in a number of ways to prove this point.

Modeling the paper, I think we can utilize our data sets in two ways to draw important conclusions.

1) ANALYSIS. How many hosts have more than one listing?
This would indicate that the AirBnB rentals are not just families providing rooms in their own homes for rent,
but commercial actors who are buying up properties in order to make a profit using AirBnB.

Visualization set 1: Use our data sets for Barcelona, London, Paris (let's just choose three) to determine how many
hosts have more than one listing.

2) ANALYSIS. Number of AirBnb homes in the area versus total number of homes. I found number of homes data
on the following links for our cities:

Barcelona: Total 811,106 family dwellings. (684,078 are main; 38,769 are secondary, 88,259 are vacant.)

London: Will need to be tallied from data set below; categories

Paris: The total number of residences in the city of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. 
Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).[124]
